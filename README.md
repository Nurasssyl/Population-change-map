I have made a map of the change in the population of Kazakhstan over the last 30 years of independence . 

I developed this visualization using the R programming language using the libraries: tidyverse, giscoR, terra, tidyterra. 

The pink one is where there are fewer people, the green one is where the number of people has increased, and the gray one is uninhabited. ðŸŒ´ 

Looking at this map, we can draw several conclusions:

1. There is an active process of urbanization. People are moving to cities, the capital and megacities.

2. Most of the country is uninhabited.

3. Mangystau region is actively populated.

4. Due to the drought in the south, residents moved even further south.

5. There has been a massive outflow of population in the north.

6. Different population densities are noticeable.
